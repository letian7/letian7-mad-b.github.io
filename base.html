        <h1>Growing Your Follower Base</h1>
        <p>TikTok is one of the fastest-growing social media apps ever—and for good reason. Short-form video has been taking the social media world by storm, with both brands and creators seeing a number of viral moments and opportunities to grow their platforms.</p>



<p>However, you still need the help of some good old fashioned TikTok marketing—and a few actionable tips to help you grow your followers to maximize your viral potential.</p>

<p>Throughout this article, we’re going to walk you through 17 ways to get more followers on TikTok so you can start creating content and engaging your audience today.</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
      <h2>Why follower growth on TikTok is important</h2>
<p>TikTok’s home screen is broken up into two different feeds: “Following” and “For You.” While the For You Page is dictated by the TikTok algorithm, the Following feed is filled with videos only from the accounts that user follows. This means, the more followers you have, the more Following feeds your videos will appear in—and many users do go back and forth between the feeds.</p>

<p>There are ways to get your content on the For You Page, but having your video content seen by those who follow you can also help your content go viral, help you get more engagement, and help turn those followers into customers.</p>

<p>TikTok is one of the only social media platforms with a feed specifically for people the user is following, making followers even more valuable on this platform than others. Discover how to grow your followers so you can build an engaged audience of TikTok users.</p>
 <h3>1. Identify your target audience</h3>
<p>The first step in growing your following on any social channel is to make sure you know who to target with your content and that you’re creating content that your target audience will enjoy.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to go about this for growing your TikTok following.</p>

<p>First, consider taking a look at competitors and influencers in your industry. What kinds of content are they posting? Take notes on the most popular videos and use them to come up with your own unique ideas.</p>

<p>Next, think about the kinds of content you’ve been publishing on your other feeds. While the content you publish on TikTok will likely be vastly different, you can still pinpoint some common trends and content types or ideas that you know will perform well.</p>

<p>Finally, simply take a minute to review your customer persona again and remind yourself of their likes and dislikes. What would they want to see on a platform like TikTok?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that it’s all trial and error, especially with a new and virally-driven network like TikTok. You can try a million different types of videos before you find the one that really resonates with your audience.</p>

<h3>2. Pay attention to trends</h3>
<p>Trends are a big thing on TikTok. If you’ve perused the platform before, you’ve likely noticed a few videos follow very similar outlines or use the same sound clip. This is because that type of video is trending, proving its popularity. Try to create a similar video that makes sense for your business and take advantage of relevant TikTok trends.</p>

<p>The best way to discover popular trends is to consume a lot of TikTok content. Look for recurring trends, challenges and sound bytes that you can use within your own content.</p>

<p>You can also head over to the “Search” section of your TikTok app to see trending news and topics to see if anything there stands out at you.</p>

</div>
<p>You can also take inspiration based on real life events that are happening and trending. For example, one of the biggest events throughout 2023 has been Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour. Small business Sparta Candle Co. created a Taylor Swift-inspired soap called “Afterglow,” named after one of her songs, and made a video about it:</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@spartacandleco/video/7244269106101374254" data-video-id="7244269106101374254" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@spartacandleco" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@spartacandleco?refer=embed">@spartacandleco</a> <a title="cuttinupwithduane" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cuttinupwithduane?refer=embed">#cuttinupwithduane</a> <a title="afterglow" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/afterglow?refer=embed">#afterglow</a> <a title="soap" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/soap?refer=embed">#soap</a> <a title="taylorswift" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/taylorswift?refer=embed">#taylorswift</a> <a title="swiftie" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/swiftie?refer=embed">#swiftie</a> <a title="taylornation" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/taylornation?refer=embed">#taylornation</a> <a title="swifttok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/swifttok?refer=embed">#swifttok</a> <a title="lover" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lover?refer=embed">#lover</a> <a title="soapcutting" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/soapcutting?refer=embed">#soapcutting</a> <a title="spartacandleco" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/spartacandleco?refer=embed">#spartacandleco</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Cruel Summer - Instrumental - Guitar Tribute Players" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Cruel-Summer-Instrumental-6770222566616336385?refer=embed">♬ Cruel Summer - Instrumental - Guitar Tribute Players</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
<p>The video ended up going viral, and the team later created a video about how that soap became their best-selling product to date within two days. The impact of using trends for content can be huge—especially for a small business like this one.</p>
<h3>3. Create a TikTok challenge</h3>
<p>One thing TikTok is famous for is its various video challenges, whether they’re dances, dares, etc. As you scroll through videos on the app, you’ll likely come across a few different challenges. See if any would work for your brand or consider creating your own TikTok challenge.</p>

<p>There are two main types of challenges: branded challenges and community challenges.</p>

<p>A branded challenge is one created and promoted by a brand. It’s often accompanied by a hashtag to help spread the word.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what MoonPie did here, with the #MoonPieChallenge. They introduced it with their very first video on TikTok and followed up with a couple more challenge videos.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@theoriginalmoonpie/video/6767450765033229573" data-video-id="6767450765033229573" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@theoriginalmoonpie" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theoriginalmoonpie?refer=embed">@theoriginalmoonpie</a> IT’S THE MOONPIE CHALLENGE <a title="moonpiechallenge" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/moonpiechallenge?refer=embed">#MoonPieChallenge</a> <a title="moonpie" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/moonpie?refer=embed">#MoonPie</a> <a title="challenge" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/challenge?refer=embed">#Challenge</a> <a title="tn" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tn?refer=embed">#TN</a> <a title="chattanooga" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/chattanooga?refer=embed">#Chattanooga</a> <a title="nashville" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nashville?refer=embed">#Nashville</a> <a title="memphis" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/memphis?refer=embed">#Memphis</a> <a title="knoxville" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/knoxville?refer=embed">#Knoxville</a> <a title="nashvilletn" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nashvilletn?refer=embed">#NashvilleTN</a> <a title="foryoupage" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage?refer=embed">#ForYouPage</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - moonpie" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6766091817147550470?refer=embed">♬ original sound - moonpie</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
<h3>4. Include the right hashtags</h3>
<p>Just like on Instagram, Twitter and many other social media platforms, TikTok hashtags help users find your content. But it’s important to make sure you’re using the right hashtags.</p>

<p>One practice we see many people make is simply tag all of the trending hashtags in their captions. However, please don’t do this unless those hashtags are actually relevant to what you’re posting. Otherwise, it just looks spammy.</p>

<p>Instead, start typing in relevant hashtags when creating your caption to see how many views those hashtags are getting. And don’t forget to include the ever-popular #fyp or #foryou hashtags, popularly used in an attempt to get on the For You page. While the effect of these hashtags on placement hasn’t been confirmed, their widespread use can still expand the reach of your content.</P>

</div>
<h3>5. Publish TikTok videos at the right times</h3>
<p>It’s important to find the best time to post on TikTok in order to see the most reach on your videos. You can find this information by heading into your business or creator tools and checking out your TikTok analytics.</p>

<p>In the Followers tab, scroll down to find Follower activity. Here, you’ll be able to look at what days and times your followers are most active. Try publishing your posts just before the most popular time of that day in order to see the best results.</p>
  <div class="image">
<img src="1.jpeg" alt="Your Image">
</div>
 <p>It’s also a good idea to keep a log of when you’ve published content so you can test different times to pinpoint what works best for your brand.</p>    

<h3>6. Leverage music and trending songs</h3>
<p>Incorporate popular sound bytes in your TikTok videos to help grab attention right from the jump. There are different music clips, songs and random audio clips that get reused for similar types of videos again and again, and using these can help your video’s overall performance.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from Scrub Daddy, using a sound and a video overlay that matches the song in order to create a humorous video.</p> 

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@scrubdaddy/video/7259131986789338410" data-video-id="7259131986789338410" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@scrubdaddy" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@scrubdaddy?refer=embed">@scrubdaddy</a> Plz help. <a title="scrubdaddy" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/scrubdaddy?refer=embed">#scrubdaddy</a> <a title="smile" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/smile?refer=embed">#smile</a> <a title="cleantok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cleantok?refer=embed">#cleantok</a> <a title="cleaningtiktok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cleaningtiktok?refer=embed">#cleaningtiktok</a> <a title="americasfavoritesponge" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/americasfavoritesponge?refer=embed">#americasfavoritesponge</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Scrub Daddy" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7259131999003249454?refer=embed">♬ original sound - Scrub Daddy</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
<p>One of the best ways to know which sound clips are trending is to consistently consume TikTok content as well as pay attention to what popular TikTokers and other brands are sharing. See if you can discover ways to incorporate popular songs into your own content to engage your audience.</p>
<h3>7. Add closed caption text to your videos for accessibility</h3>
<p>Social media accessibility should be a key part of your strategy. This includes things like alt text on images and captions on videos. The latter is extremely easy to implement on TikTok. First, you can automatically turn on captions (just make sure you edit them so they’re accurate) or you can even add your own closed caption text overlay.</p>
<h3>8. Create TikTok stories</h3>
<p>It seems like every social media app has stories, and TikTok has now added this feature as well. TikTok stories are video clips that can be up to 15 seconds in length and stay on your feed for 24 hour—similar to other types of stories. They’ll appear as the first video in your feed with a “Story” banner overtop so your profile visitors know it’s not a traditional video.</p>

<p>TikTok stories are a great way to share some behind-the-scenes content or other bits of random content that don’t fit in with your strategy but that you still want to share with your audience.</p>

<p>This is still a newer feature, so it’s a good idea to start using it before it becomes more mainstream. Stand out from the competition by regularly sharing content to your TikTok stories.</P>
<h3>9. Work with TikTok influencers and creators</h3>
<p>Influencer marketing is a great tactic on Instagram, but this also extends over to TikTok. With so many “TikTok-famous” users, working with influencers can be a great way to get the word out about your business.</p>

<p>Here’s an example from TikToker Jeremy Culhane. He created a video for the brand Crocs in his traditional style (humorous video with random photo montages throughout) that feels natural but is absolutely a marketing video.</p>
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@crocs/video/7236499666941234478" data-video-id="7236499666941234478" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@crocs" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@crocs?refer=embed">@crocs</a> The Crocs distribution system worked again <a title="iykyk" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/iykyk?refer=embed">#iykyk</a> <a title="croctok" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/croctok?refer=embed">#CrocTok</a> <a title="crocs" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/crocs?refer=embed">#Crocs</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Crocs" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7236499679758912299?refer=embed">♬ original sound - Crocs</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
<p>This video is posted on the Crocs profile. By using a popular TikToker, those familiar with Jeremy’s work will immediately be more interested in watching the brand video. However, many influencer content partnerships also involve the video being posted on the influencer’s page, helping the brand reach an even larger audience.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that working with TikTok influencers comes with its own costs. Depending on your marketing budget, you may want to look for micro-influencers with a highly engaged audience on TikTok to start your influencer marketing venture.</p>
<h3>10. Use TikTok features to engage your audience</h3>
<p>If you want to get more eyes on your TikTok profile, one of the best ways to do this is to engage with other videos. Like, comment and stitch/duet other users’ videos.</p>

<p>Stitching allows you to add your own video onto the end of the clip of another users’ video. This is perfect for adding your own commentary or additional content to an existing video.</p>

<p>Dueting places your video next to another users’ video so you can react to or complement an existing video with your own content.</p>

<p>Be sure to own stitch or duet videos that are hyper-relevant to your brand. Otherwise, just like and comment on videos that your target audience creates to grab their attention.</p>

<p>Take advantage of Sprout Social’s TikTok integration to schedule out your video content, especially if you’re bulk-creating videos.</p>
