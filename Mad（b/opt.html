<section class="section1">
        <h2 id="section1">What are TikTok hashtags?</h2>
        <p>TikTok hashtags are words or key phrases that are denoted by the hashtag (#) symbol and used to categorize content on the platform so users can browse content easily.</p>

<p>Hashtags on TikTok work just like they do on platforms like Instagram and Twitter. Adding a certain hashtag to a video will make the content discoverable when someone searches for the hashtag. This allows users to join in on trending or relevant conversations using the right hashtags.</p>

<p>For example, someone searching for the hashtag #gaming on TikTok can discover video content related to gaming only if that hashtag has been added to the video description. Or if someone searches for the hashtag #BookTok, they’ll find content from that specific TikTok subculture.</p>

<p>Being an entertainment-focused platform, TikTok naturally sees the most hashtag views for entertainment content with 535 billion views. The second most popular category is dance, with 181 billion hashtag views. Pranks, fitness and sports, home renovations/DIY and beauty/skincare are other popular categories by number of hashtag views.</p>

        <h2 id="section2">7 Benefits of using hashtags in your TikTok strategy</h2>
        <p>Incorporating hashtags into your TikTok marketing strategy is a must. Learn seven benefits your account can get from using hashtags in your video captions.</p>
         <h3>1. Increase visibility</h3>
         <p>Adding hashtags to your captions can help you get your content in front of TikTok users who aren’t already following your brand. When you use a hashtag relevant to the content of the video, you could attract people who are already interested in the topic.</p>

<p>For example, adding the hashtag #DIYProject could help your video show up in the search results of people who are searching for the hashtag.</p>
<div class="image">

 </div>
     <h3>2.Boost engagement</h3>
<p>Better visibility could also translate to higher engagement rates. When more people see your TikTok content, there’s a chance many of them would want to engage with it by liking or commenting on it.</p>
    <h3>3.Build community</h3>
<p>Branded TikTok hashtags are a great way to create a community around your business. You could encourage your audience to create videos using a brand-specific hashtag. This will help you build a strong community of followers who enjoy sharing content related or relevant to your business.</p>

<p>For example, Jellycat has managed to build a community around the #jellycat hashtag. Users post about their own Jellycat stuffies, talk about launches and more. The hashtag has generated 1 billion views, proving just how popular these videos are.</p>

</div>
<h3>4.Identify competitors</h3>
<p>Popular industry-specific hashtags can also help you uncover other businesses that are using the hashtag. This is a great way to identify competitors that you may not already be aware of. And you can conduct a competitive analysis, checking out their profiles and content to benchmark your TikTok performance against theirs.</p>
<h3>5. Get great TikTok content ideas</h3>
<p>Searches for category-specific hashtags will bring up results for top-performing content relevant to the hashtag. This is a great way to see what resonates with your target audience and get content inspiration.</P>
<h3>6. Find relevant influencers</h3>
<p>You can also use hashtag searches to discover influential accounts that are creating content relevant to the hashtag. If you plan on running an influencer marketing campaign, this is a great way to discover TikTok influencers you can partner with.</p>
<h3>7. Jump in on trends</h3>
<p>TikTok trends come and go, but capitalizing on the right ones at the right time can help boost visibility and engagement. When you create content based on trending hashtags, you’re showing your followers that your brand is fun and relevant.</p>

<p>Discover current trends by tapping the search icon in the top right corner of your TikTok home feed. You’ll see popular trends as well as topics the app thinks you’ll like based on your activity. Browse TikTok like someone in your target audience might to see what types of content ideas pop up.</p>
